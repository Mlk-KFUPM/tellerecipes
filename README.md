# Tellerecipes

This folder contains a Vite + React setup for the TellerRecipes frontend.

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Build for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
4. Preview the production build locally:
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

You can keep iterating on the application by editing files inside `src/`; the dev server supports hot module reloading for a fast feedback loop.
